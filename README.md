# Silverblade-CSGO
Silverblade is an external cheat for CS:GO (Counter strike global offensive) written in C++ using many WINAPI functions, and MFC (Microsoft foundation class).

# What this source includes
* All classic features found in external cheats (Wallhack, aimbot, triggerbot etc.)
* Some unique features that you dont come by often in external cheats (Block bot, rank reveal, chat spam etc.)
* Horrible coding practices noone should ever follow
* A cute MFC form based GUI

# IMPORTANT disclaimer
The code quality in this release is sub-par, i wrote it when i was 16 and it was my first ever "big" C++ application, most of it is pasted off of other open source cheats (which is why you might think each seperate feature is written by a diffrent person), it is not well optimised and barely works.

This source is meant for people to play around and experiment with, do not use it in matchmaking servers as it will probably get you **banned**.
